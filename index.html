<h2>Friendship</h2>
<header>A True Bond</header>
<p>Once upon a time in a small town nestled between rolling hills and a shimmering lake, there lived a girl named Lily and a boy named Max. They were neighbors, and from the moment they could walk, they were inseparable.

    Lily had a wild mane of curly red hair and a laugh that could light up a room. She was adventurous, always leading the way on their escapades. Max, on the other hand, was quieter and more thoughtful. He had a knack for noticing the little things and loved to draw what he saw.
    
    Their favorite spot was a large oak tree at the edge of the lake, where they spent countless hours together. Lily would climb the tree with the agility of a squirrel, while Max sat beneath it, sketching the world around them. It was under this oak tree that they made a pact to be best friends forever.
    
    One summer, the town decided to hold a big fair by the lake. There were games, rides, and delicious treats. Lily and Max were ecstatic. They spent the entire day at the fair, laughing and playing. They rode the Ferris wheel, screamed on the roller coaster, and won prizes at the game stalls. Max, ever the artist, sketched the lively scene while Lily dared him to go on the scariest rides.
    
    As the sun began to set, the fairgrounds started to glow with fairy lights. Lily and Max found themselves back at their oak tree, tired but happy. They shared a funnel cake, watching the reflection of the lights dance on the lake. Lily turned to Max, a mischievous glint in her eyes, and said, "Let's make a time capsule!"
    
    The next day, they gathered their treasures. Lily put in her lucky penny and a small, worn-out teddy bear that she had since she was a baby. Max added a drawing of the fair and his favorite sketchbook. They buried the capsule under their oak tree, promising to open it in ten years.
    
    Years passed, and life took them in different directions. Lily moved to the city to study biology, while Max pursued art at a prestigious school far away. Despite the distance, they stayed in touch, sharing their dreams, successes, and even their failures. They always found time to visit their oak tree whenever they were home.
    
    Ten years to the day after they buried their time capsule, Lily and Max met again at the oak tree. They were different in many ways—older, wiser, and with new experiences under their belts—but their bond was as strong as ever. With great excitement, they dug up their time capsule.
    
    As they opened it, memories flooded back. They laughed at the sight of the old teddy bear and marveled at how much Max's drawing had improved. They spent the day reminiscing about their childhood adventures and sharing their hopes for the future.
    
    Lily and Max realized that no matter where life took them, their friendship was a constant, unbreakable bond. They decided to create a new time capsule, filled with mementos from their current lives, to be opened in another ten years.
    
    And so, under the shade of their beloved oak tree, Lily and Max made another pact. They would continue to cherish their friendship, nurture it, and celebrate it, knowing that true friends are forever, no matter the distance or time.</p>
